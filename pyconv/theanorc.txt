Note: Theanorc file written to be configured for a build with Nvidia driver 352.63/CUDA version 7.5 on Ubuntu 14.04, computations performed with an i7 4770HQ/GTX 980M (configured to be gpu0) on an Asus G751JY-DH71.

.theanorc file stored in $HOME (~/) directory

--begin .theanorc file--

[global]
floatX = float32
device = gpu0

[lib]
cnmem = 3000

[cuda]
root = /usr/local/cuda-7.5

--end .theanorc file--

Additionally, the ~/.bashrc file had the following line added to it:
    $LD_LIBRARY_PATH = /usr/local/cuda/lib64/

Note that, for the duration of this line in the ~/.bashrc file, it will disable torch.
